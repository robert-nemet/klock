# klock

## Description

Locking Kubernetes resources to prevent update or/and delete operation. Locking is done by defining `Lock` CRD. The `Lock`
define what operations should be watched and for what operation. Matching resources are done trough labels.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: klock.rnemet.dev/v1
kind: Lock
metadata:
  name: lock-sample
  namespace: test
spec:
  operations:
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE
  matcher:
    test: test
```

### Field spec

Field `spec` contains `Lock` specification. It has two sub resources:

* `operations` is a list containing operations to watch for
* `matcher` is a set of labels to match when looking for locked resources

### How it works

Based on `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` when ever one of operations is invoked:

* check if in target `namespace` exists any `Lock`
* for every found `Lock` which contains target operation:
  * try to find matching `Lock` and target object

A `lock` __will not__ lock other `lock`, even if it set by configuration.

## Configuration

Cpnfiguration is autogenerated by [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder). Initially only `Pods`, `Deployments` and,
`Secretcs` can be locked. This can be changed by modifying `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` named `klock-validating-webhook-configuration`.
As well, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations are set there as operations to watch for. If needed user can modify that as well. It is not recommended
to watch for all possible resources.

## Development

### Testing

Tests are located in folder `./tests/`:

```sh
make ktest
```

### Install tools

Tests are run by [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and [KUTTL](https://kuttl.dev/).

### Prepare local environment

Start `kind` cluster:

```sh
make make-cluster
```

Install `cert-manager`:

```sh
make cert-manager
```

### Build image locally

```sh
make make docker-build IMG=IMG=<some-registry>/klock:tag
```

Load image into local cluster: `kind load docker-image IMG=<some-registry>/klock:tag`

### Install

For development:

* Kustomize: `make deploy IMG=IMG=<some-registry>/klock:tag`
* Helm: `helm install klock klock` from `helm` folder.

To your cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f install/klock-0.0.1.yaml
```

### Run tests

```shell
make ktest
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster
